<name>National Gallery of Art Claim</name>
<background>Kevin Clark is trying to process a MyComp claim for 50 APs for the National Gallery of Art.
They were ordered through Avnet and Sysorex and Henkels and McCoy, who are listed as the 
end user is our systems.

The Sales Order ID in Birst is 24Z324593001. It is listed for $39,714.50 in Bookings.

The Sales Order ID in Sandy is the same, matching to SAP 0303221055. Sandy lists it for 
$456,258.

The SAP number does not appear in Birst Booking.

Neither one show up in Birst Shipping with those numbers. It is in the shipping report 
with a Primary Transaction ID of 8101241836. Birsh Shipping is not (9/21/2017) giving
me any data on that. I have that number in my notes.

I have a note that Chris Wade helped Kevin with the manual claim on 9/12</background>
