Extensible todo manager in Python, supporting scripted workflows and a wsgi application interface

Built with Python 3

Requires Yapsy

The text format for todos (tasks) is based on Gina Trapani's todo.txt file file format, with the 
addition of using bracketed extensions instead of single-word extensions. 

The main reason for creating yet another text-based todo manager is to protype the concept of
Workflows - pre-programmed automatically generated tasks.
