Archiving Tasks
===============

Tasker reads your todo file every time it runs, and it enumerates your tasks
and after a few weeks of heavy use you may end up with::

    >t 
    134 Call that guy about +ThatThing
    150 Hide the @evidence +ThatThing
    ---
    2 tasks shown

In order to keep your task list small and fast and low-indexed, it is useful
to archive tasks. The ``archive`` command can take care of this. By default,
tasks that were recently completed will not be archived::

    > t list -a TestProject
    37 x 2016-03-24T14:26:12 2016-03-24T14:26:30 This is a +TestProject thing
    ---
    1 task shown
    
    > t archive project TestProject
    2016-0324 14:59:28 WARNING: Project +TestProject is not old enough to archive (archive)

However, if the last task in the project is old enough, they will be archived::

    > t list -a FourthProject
    4 x 2016-03-09T14:09:13 2016-03-08T14:00:16 Log request for +FourthProject

    5 tasks shown
    
    > t archive project FourthProject
    Archived 5 tasks
    
    > t list -a FourthProject
    0 tasks shown

And this renumbers the task file::

    > t list -a TestProject
    32 x 2016-03-24T14:26:12 2016-03-24T14:26:30 This is a +TestProject thing
    ---
    1 task shown

The task number when from 37 to 32. Again, these numbers are meaningless except
as temporary identifiers.

You can also adjust the threshold for archiving tasks. The default is three
days, but you can ajust this::

    > t archive project --days 0 TestProject
    Archived 1 tasks

You can also list several projects. Only those old enough will be archived.
