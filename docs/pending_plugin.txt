The Pending Plugin
==================

This plugin provides the ``after`` command to the top level of the program.

The ``after`` command creates a new task to be completed after a given task::

    > t
    33 (A) 2016-03-25T09:09:02 order a television @shopping +LivingRoomUpdate
    ---
    1 task shown
    
    > t after 33 post @craigslist ad for old television
    (Z) 2016-03-25T09:10:16 research Sony and LG televisions @shopping +LivingRoomUpdate {pend:090902250316} {uid:091016250316}
    
    > t
    33 (A) 2016-03-25T09:09:02 order a television @shopping +LivingRoomUpdate
    34 (Z) 2016-03-25T09:10:16 post @craigslist ad for old television @shopping
           +LivingRoomUpdate
    ---
    2 tasks shown

The new task is given a priority of Z and gets the same contexts and projects
as the original task.

Once the first task is complete, the pending task in reprioritized::

    > t do 33 
    x 2016-03-25T09:09:02 2016-03-25T09:16:24 order a television @shopping +LivingRoomUpdate {uid:090902250316}
    
    > t
    34 (A) 2016-03-25T09:10:16 post @craigslist ad for old television @shopping
           +LivingRoomUpdate
    ---
    1 task shown

.. note::

    If you use the ``after`` command on an unprionitized taks, the pending
    task will appear in the list first, because priotized tasks appear before
    unprioritized tasks

If you deactivate this plugin, the pended tasks will remain, but they will not
automatically be updated when needed.

You can create multiple pended tasks off of a single task.



Under the hood
--------------

The ``after`` command adds the ``pend`` extension to the new task. The value is
the ``uid`` value of the old extension. As tasks are completed, this plugin 
checks the ``uid`` value and if it matches the ``pend`` value, it will 
reprioritize the pended task.
